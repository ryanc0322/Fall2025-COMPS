Description: Program for delivery drivers to calculate their expected weekly income. 
Inspired by the "Work Planner" from the paper "Stakeholder-Centered AI Design: Co-Designing
Worker Tools with Gig Workers through Data Probes". 
'''

'''
Part 1: Getting Started with Variables
Define variables for base pay, location, days and more. 
'''
# TODO: Fixed variables go here
base_pay = 5

# TODO: Driver set variables go here 
neighborhoods = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
days = ["Sunday"]


'''
Part 2: Calculations
Use operators to estimate weekly income. 
'''
# Neighborhood and day multipliers
neighborhood_multiplier = wi.checkList(neighborhoods)
day_multiplier = wi.checkList(days)

# TODO: Your calculations go here


'''
Part 3: Tying it Together: User Input
Allow the driver to enter their preferences and see their estimated weekly income.
