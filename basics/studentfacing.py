Description:
In this file you will create a functioning payment calculator for a 
gig-delivery-driver that takes variables like which days they are working and
where they are taking jobs from as factors that would impact their daily
pay.  This calculator will also take into consideration the amount that the
driver would have to spend on gas and takes that out of their earnings
so that they can see the net value of what they would make based on the 
values that they select.
