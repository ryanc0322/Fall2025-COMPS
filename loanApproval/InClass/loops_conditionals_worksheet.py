# ==============================

#===================
# Basic Conditionals
#===================
# Question 1
# Write a program that checks if a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero.


# Question 2
# Ask the user for their age, and print:
# • “Child” if below 13
# • “Teenager” if between 13 and 19
# • “Adult” otherwise


# Question 3
# Write a program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.


# Question 4
# Ask the user to enter a password.
# If it matches "pass12word34", print “Access granted.” Otherwise, print “Access denied.”


# Question 5
# Ask the user for a number.
# If it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”.
# If only by 3 → “Fizz”.
# If only by 5 → “Buzz”.
# Otherwise print the number.

# Question 13
# Ask the user for 10 numbers.
# Count how many are positive, negative, and zero.


# Question 14
# Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 2 and 20.


# Question 15
# Ask the user to enter 5 grades.
# Calculate and print the average.
# If average ≥ 90 then “Excellent”, 70–89 then  “Good”, below 70 then “Work harder”.

# *
# **
# ***
# ****
